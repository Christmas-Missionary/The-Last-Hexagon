# What is this?

This is an updated version of The Last Hexagon. (refactoring + changes)
As of right now, I have no interest in putting this on itch.io.

The Jam Edition can be found [here](https://christmas-missionary.itch.io/the-last-hexagon-jam-edition), with it's repo [here](https://github.com/Christmas-Missionary/MJ169).  
  
The Unlicense applies to all source code.  
Sound Effects are by me, under CC0-1.0.  
Fonts are by GGBotNet, under CC0-1.0.


# How to run 
1. Download the .zip file.  
2. Unzip the .zip file.  
3. Load up Godot (Ideally 4.3).  
4. Find the `project.godot` file.   
5. Click on "Import & Edit".  
6. Ignore all the editor errors, if there are no errors at run time, it works.  
7. Click the Play Button that says "Run Project".  

# What's with the "other_copyrights"?

`GODOT_ENGINE` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY` are text files to fulfill any licenses the Godot Engine came with.  
These are not important to the source code itself.  
`FOR_THIS_PROJECT.txt` is needed for both this repo and the game itself, as it will be displayed when the "Legal" button is pressed.
