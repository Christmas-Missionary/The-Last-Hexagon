# What is this?

This is another version of The Last Hexagon, but instead, I polish it up. (i.e. refactor, new features)  
The polished version of the game is [here](Game not uploaded yet).  

The Jam Edition can be found [here](https://christmas-missionary.itch.io/the-last-hexagon-jam-edition), with it's repo [here](https://github.com/Christmas-Missionary/MJ169).  
  
The Unlicense applies to all source code except for the fonts, sound effects, and music.  
However, those are under the public domain, too.  

# How to run 
1. Download the .zip file.  
2. Unzip the .zip file.  
3. Load up Godot.  
4. Find the `project.godot` file.   
5. Click on "Import & Edit".  
6. Ignore all the editor errors, if there are no errors at run time, it works.  
7. Click the Play Button that says "Run Project".  

# What's with the "other_copyrights"?

`GODOT_ENGINE.txt` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY.txt` are there to fulfill any licenses they come with.  
These are not important to the source code itself.  

# What about those 2 fonts?
Both of those are in the public domain, made by GGBotNet.  
Here are the sources:  
https://www.fontspace.com/unitblock-font-f104834  
https://www.fontspace.com/home-video-font-f116641  

# It doesn't work.
1. If you are on safari, check to see if Lockdown mode is off.
2. If you are on firefox, see if WebGL is on.  
  
Otherwise, comment the error on itch.io or report an issue here.
